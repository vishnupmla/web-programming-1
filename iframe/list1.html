Fruits are usually eaten raw, although some varieties can be cooked.
Fruit, the fleshy or dry ripened ovary of a flowering plant, enclosing the seed or seeds. 
Thus, apricots, bananas, and grapes, as well as bean pods, corn grains, 
tomatoes, cucumbers, and (in their shells) acorns and almonds, are all technically fruits.
