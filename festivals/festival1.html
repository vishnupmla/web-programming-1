<p><i><h3 style="color:#6F124D;text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;">Diwali or Deepavali is one of India's biggest festivals.
 The word 'Deepawali' means rows of lighted lamps. It is a Festival of Lights and Hindus celebrate it with joy.
 During this festival, people light up their houses and shops with Diyas (small cup-shaped oil lamp made of baked clay). 
They worship the Lord Ganesha for welfare and prosperity and Goddess Lakshmi for wealth and wisdom.</h3></i></p>
